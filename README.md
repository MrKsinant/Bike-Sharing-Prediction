# Bike-Sharing-Prediction

This study corresponds to the first project of Nanodegree *Deep Learning* schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** (https://eu.udacity.com), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

Its goal is to build a simple neural network from scratch and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. Here, the core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from **Capital Bikeshare system** (Washington D.C., USA), which is publicly available at http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data.

This prediction is challenged by some relevant difficulties:
* Bike sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings;
* A two-year log data set is probably not enough to capture some features, like for example classical holiday periods;
* Some events, like for example natural disasters, due to their very episodic nature, will be very difficult to predict.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:
* The file ***bike-sharing-prediction.ipynb***, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The file ***neural_network.py***, the Python code file which contains all the detail of the built neural network;
* The folder *assets*, which contains specific pictures illustrating the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository;
* The folder *bike_sharing_dataset*, which contains the dataset on which our study is based;
* The folder *graphs*, which contains all the graphs generated during the study.
